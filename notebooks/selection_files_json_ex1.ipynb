    "*Motivation:*\n",
    "As discussed in RWT selection files originally were targeted at humans not at tools -\n",
    "yet when managing 100s-1000s of selection files for replication management a machine readable solution is necessary  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Proposal:*\n",
    "* use json as a machine readable serialization format for replica selections\n",
    "* use a json storage backend to easily query the various json entries\n",
    "* provide a selection file <--> json translation\n",
    "* use this then as a platform to generate on demand selection files for usage in synda"
